# Rotten Tomatoes Analysis
An analysis of Rotten Tomato ratings across various streaming platforms

This analysis is inspired by a case study completed for the Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera. 
The business task is set by a fictional TV company looking to prioritize the software development of various streaming platform applications. They can make applications for different streaming services, but want to focus on ones with highest quality shows and widest age range first. We will be using the two data sets created by Ruchi Bhatia that are available on Kaggle. The first dataset is, “Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+”, found here: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney). The second is data set is, “TV shows on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+”, found here: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney).

The purpose of this script is to clean the data, manipulate it to prepare it for analysis, and then conduct simple analysis to answer: “Which streaming platform offers the highest quality content, as rated by Rotten Tomatoes, and which has the widest viewing age range?”
